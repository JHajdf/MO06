				<p>We all need sugar in our blood to provide cells with energy. The hormone insulin allows sugar (glucose) in your bloodstream to enter your cells, where it can used for energy. If you don’t have enough insulin, sugar stays in the bloodstream. Over time, high blood sugar levels damage your blood vessels. This can cause other problems, such as coronary heart disease, kidney disease and diabetic eye disease.It’s important to know whether you have high blood sugar so that this can be controlled, reducing the risk of damage.</p>

				<h5>Am I at risk of diabetes?</h5>
				<p>● Any of the following can mean you’re at risk, especially if more than one of these applies:</p>
				<p>being over the age of 40</p>
				<p>● south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African background</p>
				<p>● a close relative has diabetes</p>
				<p>● overweight or large waist size</p>
				<p>● high blood pressure</p>
				<p>● pregnancy or previous gestational diabetes</p>
				<p>● polycystic ovary syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar illness or depression, or you are taking antipsychotic medication.</p>

				<h5>What if I have diabetes?</h5>
				<p>Monitor your blood sugar levels at home using a glucose meter. This involves pricking your finger and applying a drop of blood to a test strip.                                 </p>
				<p>Self-monitoring can be a helpful part of diabetes management. Regular blood sugar tests help you see how specific changes, for example around diet and physical activity, affect blood sugar levels. Monitoring can also help your healthcare team adjust your treatment to best prevent any long-term complications. Your doctor should also check HbA1c levels at least yearly to assess long-term blood sugar control</p>
