				<p>Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body.</p>
				<p>How is blood pressure measured?</p>
				<p>Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 figures:</p>
				<p>1.systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out</p>
				<p>2.diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats</p>
				<p>For example, if your blood pressure is "140 over 90" or 140/90mmHg, it means you have a systolic pressure of 140mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 90mmHg.</p>
				<p>As a general guide:</p>
				<p>1.ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg</p>
				<p>2.high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher</p>
				<p>3.low blood pressure is considered to be below 90/60mmHg</p>

				<h5>High blood pressure</h5>
				<p>High blood pressure is often related to unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight and not exercising enough.</p>
				<p>Left untreated, high blood pressure can increase your risk of developing a number of serious long-term health conditions, including coronary heart disease. You also risk damaging the blood vessels in your kidneys or eyes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Low blood pressure</h5>
				<p>Low blood pressure is less common. Some medicines can cause low blood pressure as a side effect. It can also be caused by a number of underlying conditions, including heart failure and dehydration.</p>
