				<p>Diabetes occurs when your body does not process food as energy properly. Insulin is a critical hormone that gets glucose (sugar that is used as energy) to the cells in your body. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t respond to insulin or doesn’t produce insulin at all. This causes sugars to build up in your blood, which puts you at risk of dangerous complications.</p>

				<h5>Types of Diabetes</h5>
				<p>Diabetes can be classified as type 1, type 2 or gestational.</p>
            </li>

				<h5>Type 1 Diabetes</h5>
				<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the body that produce insulin. The rate of type 1 diabetes is rising worldwide, with the greatest increase occurring in children younger than age 5.</p>
				<p>In people with type 1 diabetes, the body does not make enough of the hormone insulin, which enables the body to convert glucose (a simple sugar) into energy. Type 1 diabetes develops when the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed due to an autoimmune process in which the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys its own organs or tissues. The onset of symptoms can happen quickly. People with type 1 diabetes may need daily insulin shots.</p>
			</li>
            <li>
				<h5>Type 2 Diabetes</h5>
				<p>Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results from the body’s inability to make enough insulin or to properly use insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin, but the body cannot use it effectively. This is referred to as insulin resistance. Gradually, insulin production slows down, as is the case in type 1 diabetes. Previously unheard of in children and teens, type 2 diabetes is now being diagnosed more often in children and teens, which some research links to increasing rates of childhood obesity.</p>

            <li>
				<h5>Gestational Diabetes</h5>
				<p>Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy when a hormone made by the placenta prevents the mother’s body from using insulin effectively. It is not caused by a lack of insulin but by other hormones produced during pregnancy that can make insulin less effective. Gestational diabetic symptoms disappear following delivery of the baby.</p>
